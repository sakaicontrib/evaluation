      Online Course and Instructor Ratings

       The Evaluation System is a tool that runs under Sakai version 2.2 or higher. The Evaluation System is
      used to conduct formative and summative (end of term) evaluations and review the results. An evaluation
      consists of a series of scaled and/or free text questions, which are delivered to students over a fixed
      time period (typically a few days).

      The evaluation system allows colleges, departments, and instructors to manage their own body of
      questions which are part of a combined end of term evaluation. This allows colleges and departments
      within a larger institution to collect targeted information from their students, while preserving a
      consistent set of questions used through the institution.

      Evaluation results can easily be reviewed within a single course, across colleges or departments, or
      across the entire university. Results can be reviewed for a single evaluation covering a short time
      period, or can be displayed for a series of evaluations conducted across a larger time period.

      The evaluation system contacts students to notify them of upcoming evaluations automatically, and to
      remind students to complete an ongoing evaluation. The notification scheme is intended to increase the
      response rate.
