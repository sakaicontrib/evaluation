      Online Course and Instructor Ratings

      The Evaluation System is a tool that runs under Sakai version 2.2 or higher. The
      Evaluation System is used to conduct formative and summative (end of term) evaluations
      and review the results. An evaluation consists of a series of scaled and/or free text
      questions, which are delivered to students over a fixed time period (typically a few
      days).

      The evaluation system allows colleges, departments, and instructors to manage their
      own body of questions which are part of a combined end of term evaluation. This allows
      colleges and departments within a larger institution to collect targeted information
      from their students, while preserving a consistent set of questions used through the
      institution.

      Evaluation results can easily be reviewed within a single course, across colleges or
      departments, or across the entire university. Results can be reviewed for a single
      evaluation covering a short time period, or can be displayed for a series of
      evaluations conducted across a larger time period.

      The evaluation system contacts students to notify them of upcoming evaluations
      automatically, and to remind students to complete an ongoing evaluation. The
      notification scheme is intended to increase the response rate.
