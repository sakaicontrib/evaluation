/**
 * Handles all logic associated with setting up and creating evaluations,
 * this includes all the logic for assigning groups and users to an evaluation
 * and processing the email templates used by an evaluation<br/>
 * Note that the handling and linkage of participants to an evaluation can be confusing.
 * It is all based on assigning users/group/nodes to the evaluation. These assignments are like
 * enrollments in some ways and can be updated before the evaluation begins (and to a limited degree
 * while it is running as well). For clarity this is how it works for a developer:<br/>
 * The evaluation has either users, groups, or hierarchy nodes assigned to it. User are indirectly
 * assigned to the evaluation via groups or hierarchy nodes OR directly assigned to it using the
 * participant methods. <br/>
 * There are methods for lookup and reading of these assignments in {@link EvalEvaluationService}
 * so look there when trying to determine what the current assignments are.<br/>
 * {@link EvalEvaluationService#getAssignGroupById(Long)} <br/>
 * {@link EvalEvaluationService#getAssignGroupsForEvals(Long[], boolean, Boolean)} <br/>
 * {@link EvalEvaluationService#getAssignHierarchyByEval(Long)} <br/>
 * {@link EvalEvaluationService#getAssignHierarchyById(Long)} <br/>
 * {@link EvalEvaluationService#getEvalGroupsForEval(Long[], boolean, Boolean)} <br/>
 * Here are the assignment write methods broken down:<br/>
 * Users - TODO <br/>
 * Groups/Hierarchy - {@link #setEvalAssignments(Long, String[], String[], boolean)} 
 * (this is the method you should use most of the time for assigning groups or hierarchy nodes) <br/>
 * Groups - {@link #saveAssignGroup(EvalAssignGroup, String)}, {@link #deleteAssignGroup(Long, String)} <br/>
 * Hierachy - {@link #deleteAssignHierarchyNodesById(Long[])} <br/>
 * <br/>
 * (Note for developers - do not modify this without permission from the project lead)
