This folder contains all the javascript used in this project. 
The structure is laid out as shown below so please adhere to this practice when adding new JS files.
/js - js files written for this project
  /(dir) - js files from other frameworks (e.g. /jquery)

The files in /js are written for the eval project 
and any files that are imported are placed into the subfolders.
Please ensure that you do not import duplicates.
Thanks
