/**
 * This interface provides methods to get external eval groups and enrollments into the
 * evaluation system<br/>
 * This interface can and should be implemented and then spring loaded to allow
 * an institution to bring in external eval groups without needing to load them all
 * into Sakai or a similar system<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The spring bean must have an id that matches the fully qualified classname for this interface<br/>
 * Example:
 * <xmp>
 * <bean id="org.sakaiproject.evaluation.providers.EvalGroupsProvider"
 * 		class="org.sakaiproject.yourproject.impl.EvalGroupsProviderImpl">
 * </bean>
 * </xmp>
 * <br/>
 * The 3 permissions this provider has to deal with 
 * are {@link #PERM_BE_EVALUATED} (roughly equivalent to instructor role) 
 * and {@link #PERM_TAKE_EVALUATION} (roughly equivalent to student role) 
 * and {@link #PERM_TA_ROLE} (roughly equivalent to teaching assistants role), 
 * compare the incoming permission to the constant
 * and only handle the cases indicated (do not try to handle all possible permissions)<br/>
 * <b>Note</b>: Specifically this allows us to reference eval groups and enrollments which
 * are not stored in something like Sakai
 * <br/>
 * <b>Note</b>: If the type is set for the {@link EvalGroup} object then it should be EvalConstants.GROUP_TYPE_PROVIDED,
 * however, this should not be necessary
